			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard project initialization steps with well-documented commands. The complexity is moderate due to the need to configure multiple services (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Supabase, Vercel) but follows established patterns with clear documentation.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Setup and Configuration task into 4 subtasks: 1) Next.js project initialization with TypeScript and Tailwind, 2) Supabase client configuration and environment setup, 3) Additional dependencies installation and configuration, and 4) Vercel deployment pipeline setup. For each subtask, provide detailed steps, commands, and configuration files needed."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "Creating a complex database schema with multiple tables, relationships, and security policies requires careful planning and implementation. The task involves writing SQL, setting up Row Level Security, and generating TypeScript types, adding significant complexity.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Database Schema Implementation task into 5 subtasks: 1) Core tables creation (profiles, projects, items), 2) Secondary tables creation (brands, tags), 3) Junction tables and relationships setup, 4) Row Level Security policies implementation for each table, and 5) TypeScript type generation and validation. For each subtask, provide the SQL statements and configuration details needed."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Authentication System Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"reasoning": "Authentication is inherently complex due to security considerations, multiple flows (signup, login, verification), and role-based access control. This requires careful implementation of middleware, form validation, and secure database operations.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Authentication System Implementation task into 6 subtasks: 1) Signup page and form implementation, 2) Login page and form implementation, 3) Email verification flow, 4) User profile creation and status management, 5) Authentication middleware for route protection, and 6) Role-based access control implementation. For each subtask, provide the component structure, key functions, and security considerations."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Common Layout and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating reusable UI components and layouts with conditional rendering based on user roles. While not technically complex, it requires attention to design details, responsive layouts, and proper component organization.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Common Layout and Navigation task into 4 subtasks: 1) Admin layout implementation with responsive design, 2) Side navigation component with role-based visibility, 3) Header component with user info and actions, and 4) Reusable UI component library creation (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.). For each subtask, provide the component structure, styling approach, and conditional rendering logic."

			"taskTitle": "Project Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves complete CRUD operations, form handling with multiple fields, image uploads, tagging functionality, and complex relationships between projects, items, and tags. The UI complexity and data management requirements are substantial.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Project Management Module task into 7 subtasks: 1) Project service implementation with CRUD operations, 2) Project list page with filtering and pagination, 3) Project detail/view page, 4) Project create/edit form with validation, 5) Project cover image upload functionality, 6) Project gallery management with ordering capability, and 7) Tag and item relationship management. For each subtask, provide the component structure, data flow, and validation requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Item Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "This module requires CRUD operations, form handling, and relationship management with brands. It's moderately complex due to the search/filter functionality and image upload requirements, but less complex than the project management module.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Item Management Module task into 5 subtasks: 1) Item service implementation with CRUD operations, 2) Item list page with search, filtering and pagination, 3) Item detail/view page, 4) Item create/edit form with brand relationship, and 5) Item image upload functionality. For each subtask, provide the component structure, data flow, and validation requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Brand Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"reasoning": "This module is similar to the item management but with fewer fields and simpler relationships. The complexity comes from image handling and ensuring unique brand names, but overall it's a straightforward CRUD implementation.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Brand Management Module task into 4 subtasks: 1) Brand service implementation with CRUD operations, 2) Brand list page with grid/table view, 3) Brand detail/view page, and 4) Brand create/edit form with image upload and validation. For each subtask, provide the component structure, data flow, and validation requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Tag Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"reasoning": "Tag management involves both standalone CRUD operations and a reusable tag selector component that will be used across the application. The complexity comes from the inline editing capability and managing tag relationships with projects and images.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Tag Management Module task into 4 subtasks: 1) Tag service implementation with CRUD operations, 2) Tag management page with inline editing, 3) Reusable tag selector component development, and 4) Tag relationship implementation for projects and images. For each subtask, provide the component structure, state management approach, and reusability considerations."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "User Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "User management involves sensitive operations like role changes and access control. The complexity comes from ensuring proper security, handling user status changes correctly, and implementing master-only access restrictions.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Management Module task into 5 subtasks: 1) User service implementation with CRUD operations, 2) User list page with filtering, 3) User status management functionality, 4) User role management functionality, and 5) Access control implementation for master-only features. For each subtask, provide the component structure, security considerations, and validation requirements."

			"taskTitle": "Image Upload and Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"reasoning": "Image handling is inherently complex due to file processing, storage management, and UI considerations. This task involves drag-and-drop functionality, progress indicators, reordering capabilities, and optimization, making it technically challenging.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Image Upload and Management task into 6 subtasks: 1) Image service implementation for upload/delete operations, 2) Reusable image uploader component with drag-and-drop, 3) Image preview and progress indicator functionality, 4) Gallery management with reordering capability, 5) Image tagging interface, and 6) Image optimization implementation.
